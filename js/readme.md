When I created this repository I copied the JS library from another project.

Only a small number of these .js files are actually used for the CSV table project.   There are others that use canvas graphics and SVG to draw data from the CSV.  

If people are interested in seeing these other pieces of functionality then [*contact me*](http://bayesanalytic.com/main/technical-engineering/machine-learning/)
